Tutorial Repository

Hi Reader,

Figuring out the interface for GitHub. I'm aware it is a file repository, good for version control. Makes me wonder if this would have been a viable solution for other professional version control needs of my past (e.g., collaborative reporting). Really I'm just typing here to have something.
